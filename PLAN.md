# Omega — Self-Improving AI Coding Agent

## Vision

A personal AI coding agent that:
- Is primarily for coding, but usable for general tasks
- Is private / single-user — configuration can be code
- Can **bootstrap itself**: iterate on its own codebase as fast as possible
- Is **self-observing**: exposes logs, metrics, API usage, and cost data so that
  AI (including itself) can analyze and improve the agent
- Teaches its operator the Anthropic API by making its own API usage transparent
- Can **operate itself** to test its own features

## Design Principles

1. **Tight iteration loop** — The agent modifies itself, tests, and reloads
   with minimal friction. Errors and backtracking are minimized.
2. **Terminal-native** — The agent's primary UI is Ink (React for the
   terminal). The agent can see its own rendered output as text, run its
   tests, and verify results — all without leaving the terminal. This makes
   the agent the fastest possible self-iterator. A browser UI comes later
   for richer human experience.
3. **Observability first** — Structured logs, API call traces, token counts,
   cost estimates, latency measurements, and decision traces are first-class.
4. **API transparency** — Every request/response to the provider is visible.
   Token usage and estimated cost are always shown.
5. **Low latency UX** — Streaming responses from the first token. The UI must
   never block or feel sluggish.
6. **UI-technology-independent design** — The *logical layout* (what
   information goes where, how panes relate) is defined abstractly. The same
   layout specification drives any renderer. If the layout should show a chat
   pane beside an observability pane, that's true regardless of whether it's
   rendered with Ink in a terminal or React in a browser.
7. **Self-testable** — From an early version onward, the agent must be able to
   drive itself (send inputs, observe outputs) for automated end-to-end
   testing. Features are pinned down by E2E tests so regressions are caught.
8. **Stable core, evolvable surface** — From a defined early milestone, the
   core (agent loop, provider adapter, tool dispatch) is stable enough that the
   agent can reliably fix itself if bugs arise. Surface features (UI, new
   tools) evolve freely on top.
9. **Full machine access** — The agent can use anything available on the Linux
   machine. The only boundary is `sudo`: when root privileges are needed, the
   agent asks the operator to either run the command themselves or enter the
   password. Everything else is fair game.
10. **Graduated trust** — In early phases, the agent asks the operator to
    confirm commands before executing them. As trust is established, the
    operator can widen the auto-approve policy until only destructive or
    privileged operations require confirmation.

## Decisions Made

### Language: TypeScript

TypeScript is the clear choice for this project:
- First-party Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`)
- No compilation step — fastest possible edit-run loop
- AI models produce high-quality TypeScript with low error rates
- Massive ecosystem for everything we'll need
- Same language and React component model for terminal UI and future browser UI

### Runtime: Bun

Bun is the best fit for a self-improving agent:
- Native TypeScript execution — no compile step, no `tsx` wrapper
- Fastest startup (~5x faster than Node+tsx) — critical when the agent
  restarts itself on every self-modification
- Built-in test runner (can replace Vitest if desired)
- Full compatibility with the Anthropic SDK
- Ink 6.x + ink-testing-library 4.x confirmed working (smoke-tested)
- npm-compatible — full ecosystem access

**Verified compatibility** (smoke test 2025-02-21):
- Ink rendering, flexbox layout, borders, text styling ✅
- `<Static>` zone ✅
- State updates / streaming simulation ✅
- `ink-testing-library` render + assert ✅
- `useInput` with TTY ✅
- Clean exit ✅

### UI Strategy: Terminal-First (Ink), Browser Later (Vite + React)

**Terminal-first for fastest agent iteration:**
- The agent's tools are all terminal-based (read files, write files, run
  commands). Terminal output is its native medium.
- Ink renders React components as text — the agent can literally read what
  its own UI looks like by running it.
- `ink-testing-library` lets the agent render components and inspect output
  as strings — no browser, no screenshots, no Playwright process.
- Errors, stack traces, React errors — all directly readable in stdout/stderr.
- Single process. No browser to launch, coordinate, or debug through.
- Edit → run → see output. The tightest possible loop for a text-native AI.

**Browser later for richer human experience:**
- Vite + React will be added as a second renderer
- Same React component model, same hooks, same layout descriptor
- The abstract layout ensures the browser UI is a bounded implementation task,
  not a rearchitecting effort
- Browser DevTools, visual layout inspection, etc. benefit the human operator

**Why terminal-first over browser-first?**
The primary developer of this agent is the agent itself. Browser DevTools are
excellent for humans but invisible to the model. The agent cannot see hot
reloads, inspect DOM elements, or use React DevTools. In the terminal, the
agent can see everything. Optimizing for the agent's iteration speed means
terminal-first.

**Architecture implication:**
```
Agent Core (pure TypeScript — no framework imports)
    ↓ exposes
Agent API (function calls, events, state)
    ↓ consumed by
├── Terminal Renderer (Ink)             ← M0
└── Browser Renderer (Vite + React)    ← future
```

The agent core must never import from `react`, `ink`, or `vite`. Renderers
are thin consumers of the core API. Shared React hooks (like
`useStreamingMessage()`) can live in a shared package used by both renderers.

### API Interaction: Streaming SSE

Anthropic has no persistent sockets. Every interaction is an HTTP request.
With `"stream": true`, the response arrives as Server-Sent Events:

```
message_start → content_block_start → content_block_delta* → content_block_stop → message_delta → message_stop
```

The TypeScript SDK wraps this with `client.messages.stream()` which provides
`.text_stream` (async iterator of text chunks) and `.finalMessage()`.

- **User-facing interactions**: Always streaming (low latency)
- **Background/batch operations**: May use non-streaming for simplicity
- **Token usage**: Available in `message_delta` event and final `usage` object

## Tool Strategy

### Full Machine Access

The agent has unrestricted access to the Linux machine as the current user.
It can:
- Read, write, and delete any file the user owns
- Run any command (compilers, package managers, git, curl, docker, systemctl,
  etc.)
- Install packages, manage services, configure the system
- Access the network (APIs, downloads, SSH to other machines)
- Use any tool installed or installable on the machine

### The sudo Boundary

The only hard boundary is privilege escalation. When a command requires `sudo`:

1. **Agent recognizes** it needs root (or the command fails with permission
   denied)
2. **Agent asks the operator** with one of:
   - "This needs sudo. Please run: `sudo ...`" (operator does it themselves)
   - "This needs sudo. Enter your password and I'll run it" (agent runs
     `sudo` with the password provided via secure input)
3. **Agent never stores** the sudo password beyond the immediate use

### Graduated Trust Model

Command execution has a trust level that the operator controls:

```typescript
type TrustLevel = 'confirm-all' | 'confirm-destructive' | 'auto'

interface TrustPolicy {
  level: TrustLevel
  // Patterns that always require confirmation regardless of trust level
  alwaysConfirm: string[]   // e.g., ['rm -rf', 'sudo', 'reboot', 'dd ']
  // Patterns that are always auto-approved regardless of trust level
  alwaysAllow: string[]     // e.g., ['ls', 'cat', 'git status', 'grep']
}
```

**`confirm-all`** (default, early phase):
Every command is shown to the operator before execution. The operator sees
exactly what will run and approves or rejects it. This is how trust is built.

**`confirm-destructive`** (after initial trust):
Read-only and safe commands run automatically. Commands that modify files,
install packages, or touch system config require confirmation. The agent
classifies commands using pattern matching and a conservative default
(unknown = confirm).

**`auto`** (full trust):
Everything runs automatically except commands matching `alwaysConfirm`
patterns (sudo, rm -rf, etc.). The operator has decided they trust the agent.

The trust level can be changed at any time via a command in the agent UI.
The `alwaysConfirm` list is always respected regardless of trust level.

## Testing Strategy

### Layered Approach

1. **Unit tests**: Pure functions (message formatting, cost calculation,
   tool parsing)
2. **Component tests**: Ink components via ink-testing-library (render to
   string, assert on text output)
3. **Integration tests**: Agent core + mock provider (no real API calls)
4. **E2E tests**: ink-testing-library for full UI scenarios — render the
   app, send input, assert on output. All text-based, all readable by the
   agent.
5. **Self-tests**: Agent drives itself through scenarios (programmatic
   API, not UI)

### Why ink-testing-library Works for Agent Self-Iteration

The agent can:
- Render any component and read the output as a string
- Send keystrokes and input programmatically
- Assert that the right text appears
- Do all of this in-process, fast, no external dependencies

This is vastly simpler than Playwright for the agent's purposes. The agent
reads text natively. The UI outputs text. Perfect match.

### Self-Operation

The agent can also test itself via the **Agent API** directly (bypassing UI):
- Send a message programmatically
- Observe the response, tool calls, token usage
- Verify correctness

This is even faster than UI tests and validates core logic independent of
rendering.

### Test Infrastructure

- Test runner: `bun test` (native, fast, built-in) or Vitest
- Component testing: ink-testing-library
- API mocking: Record/replay of SSE streams, or mock provider adapter
- CI: Tests run on every self-modification before the new version is accepted

## UI Architecture

### Abstract Layout Model

The layout is defined as a **logical structure** independent of rendering
technology. This same structure drives the Ink renderer and (later) the
browser renderer.

```

│  │  └───────────────────────────────┘  └────────┘ │   │
│  │                                                │   │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                       │
│  ┌─ Status Bar ──────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │ Model │ Tokens (in/out) │ Cost │ Latency      │   │

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

In Ink, the Static Zone maps directly to `<Static>`. The Live Zone is the
re-rendering area. The Status Bar is a fixed-position bottom row.

See `DESIGN-UI.md` for the full layout descriptor specification.

## Self-Modification Strategy

The agent needs to modify itself and validate the changes. The approach:

1. **Edit** — Agent writes changes to its own source files (tool use)
2. **Validate** — Agent runs its test suite against the modified code
3. **Spawn** — Agent starts a new process with the modified code
4. **Smoke test** — New process runs a self-test scenario
5. **Swap** — If all checks pass, the new process takes over; old one exits
6. **Rollback** — If any check fails, changes are reverted (git)

State (conversation history, config) is persisted to disk so it survives
process restarts.

Git is integral: every self-modification is a commit. Failed modifications
are reverted. The git log becomes an audit trail of the agent's evolution.

## Stable Core Contract

From M1 onward, the following interfaces are frozen (backwards-compatible
changes only):

- **Tool interface**: How tools are defined, dispatched, and return results
- **Provider adapter interface**: How the agent talks to the LLM
- **Observability hooks**: How logs and metrics are emitted
- **Self-operation interface**: How the agent drives itself for testing
- **Trust policy interface**: How trust levels and confirmation work

This guarantees that even if the agent introduces a bug in surface code, it
retains the ability to:
1. Read its own source
2. Run its tests
3. Identify the failure
4. Fix the code
5. Validate the fix
